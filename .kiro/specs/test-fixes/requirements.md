# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The test suite is currently failing with 21 failed tests out of 233 total tests. The failures fall into three main categories: database constraint violations during test cleanup, TypeScript compilation errors in unit tests due to improper mock typing, and integration test failures where expected data is not found. This feature will systematically address all test failures to ensure a reliable and maintainable test suite.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all database constraint violations during test cleanup to be resolved, so that integration tests can run reliably without foreign key constraint errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the test cleanup process runs THEN the system SHALL delete records in the correct order to avoid foreign key constraint violations
2. WHEN member records are deleted THEN the system SHALL first delete all dependent records (points, member_privileges) before deleting members
3. WHEN the test database is cleaned up THEN the system SHALL complete without any foreign key constraint errors

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all TypeScript compilation errors in unit tests to be fixed, so that the test suite can compile and run successfully.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN unit tests are compiled THEN the system SHALL not produce any TypeScript errors related to mock method typing
2. WHEN Prisma client methods are mocked THEN the system SHALL use properly typed mock implementations
3. WHEN jest mocks are created for Prisma methods THEN the system SHALL maintain type safety while allowing test mocking

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all integration test assertions to pass, so that I can trust the test results reflect actual system behavior.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN privilege repository tests run THEN the system SHALL return correct pagination results with accurate total counts
2. WHEN filtering tests execute THEN the system SHALL return properly filtered data based on isActive and pointCost criteria
3. WHEN member privilege tests run THEN the system SHALL properly create and retrieve member privilege relationships
4. WHEN test data is seeded THEN the system SHALL ensure all required relationships and constraints are satisfied

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the test suite to run completely without failures, so that I can confidently deploy code changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the full test suite runs THEN the system SHALL pass all 233 tests without any failures
2. WHEN tests are executed THEN the system SHALL complete within a reasonable time frame
3. WHEN test results are reported THEN the system SHALL show 0 failed tests and maintain the current number of passing tests
