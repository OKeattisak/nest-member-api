# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a comprehensive member service system built with NestJS, Prisma, and PostgreSQL. The system will manage members, implement a point system with FIFO expiration, provide privilege exchange functionality, and include separate admin and member interfaces with JWT authentication. The system will follow Domain-Driven Design principles and include comprehensive logging and tracing for observability.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to manage members through dedicated admin APIs, so that I can control user access and maintain system integrity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an admin authenticates THEN the system SHALL validate credentials using admin-specific JWT secret key
2. WHEN an admin requests member list THEN the system SHALL return paginated member data with filtering options
3. WHEN an admin creates a new member THEN the system SHALL validate member data and store it securely
4. WHEN an admin updates member information THEN the system SHALL validate changes and update the database
5. WHEN an admin deletes a member THEN the system SHALL soft delete the member and maintain audit trail
6. IF admin token is invalid or expired THEN the system SHALL return 401 unauthorized error

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a member, I want to register and login to the system, so that I can access my account and manage my points.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a new user registers THEN the system SHALL validate email uniqueness and password strength
2. WHEN a member logs in with valid credentials THEN the system SHALL return a JWT token with member-specific secret
3. WHEN a member accesses protected endpoints THEN the system SHALL validate the member JWT token
4. WHEN a member requests their profile THEN the system SHALL return their current information and point balance
5. IF member credentials are invalid THEN the system SHALL return appropriate error message
6. WHEN a member updates their profile THEN the system SHALL validate and save the changes

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to manage member points through admin APIs, so that I can award, deduct, or adjust member point balances.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an admin adds points to a member THEN the system SHALL create a point transaction record with timestamp
2. WHEN an admin deducts points from a member THEN the system SHALL validate sufficient balance and create deduction record
3. WHEN an admin views point history THEN the system SHALL return chronological transaction list with details
4. WHEN points are added THEN the system SHALL implement FIFO queuing for point expiration tracking
5. WHEN points expire THEN the system SHALL automatically deduct expired points using FIFO order
6. WHEN point balance is requested THEN the system SHALL calculate current balance excluding expired points

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a member, I want to exchange my points for privileges, so that I can utilize my earned rewards.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a member requests available privileges THEN the system SHALL return list of privileges with point costs
2. WHEN a member exchanges points for privileges THEN the system SHALL validate sufficient point balance
3. WHEN privilege exchange occurs THEN the system SHALL deduct points using FIFO order and grant privilege access
4. WHEN a member views their privileges THEN the system SHALL return active privileges with expiration dates
5. IF member has insufficient points THEN the system SHALL return error with required point amount
6. WHEN privilege expires THEN the system SHALL automatically revoke access

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to manage privileges through admin APIs, so that I can create, update, and configure available rewards.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an admin creates a privilege THEN the system SHALL validate privilege data and store configuration
2. WHEN an admin updates privilege details THEN the system SHALL modify existing privilege settings
3. WHEN an admin sets privilege point cost THEN the system SHALL update the exchange rate
4. WHEN an admin deactivates a privilege THEN the system SHALL prevent new exchanges while maintaining existing grants
5. WHEN an admin views privilege usage THEN the system SHALL return analytics on exchange frequency and member engagement

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want standardized API responses, so that client applications can handle responses consistently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any API endpoint succeeds THEN the system SHALL return response in standard success format with data and metadata
2. WHEN any API endpoint fails THEN the system SHALL return response in standard error format with error code and message
3. WHEN validation fails THEN the system SHALL return detailed field-level error information
4. WHEN system errors occur THEN the system SHALL return generic error message without exposing internal details
5. WHEN API responses are sent THEN the system SHALL include appropriate HTTP status codes
6. WHEN pagination is used THEN the system SHALL include pagination metadata in response

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want comprehensive logging and tracing, so that I can monitor system health and troubleshoot issues effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any API request is received THEN the system SHALL log request details with unique trace ID
2. WHEN database operations occur THEN the system SHALL log query execution time and results
3. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL log error details with stack trace and context
4. WHEN authentication attempts happen THEN the system SHALL log login attempts with outcome
5. WHEN point transactions occur THEN the system SHALL log transaction details for audit trail
6. WHEN system starts THEN the system SHALL log startup sequence and configuration status

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system built with Domain-Driven Design principles, so that the codebase is maintainable and follows best practices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the project is structured THEN the system SHALL organize code into domain, application, and infrastructure layers
2. WHEN business logic is implemented THEN the system SHALL encapsulate domain rules within domain entities
3. WHEN data access occurs THEN the system SHALL use repository pattern to abstract database operations
4. WHEN services are created THEN the system SHALL separate application services from domain services
5. WHEN dependencies are managed THEN the system SHALL use dependency injection following SOLID principles
6. WHEN TypeScript is used THEN the system SHALL enforce strict mode compilation settings

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want point expiration functionality, so that points maintain their value and encourage active member engagement.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN points are awarded THEN the system SHALL assign expiration date based on configurable policy
2. WHEN points reach expiration date THEN the system SHALL automatically expire points using FIFO order
3. WHEN expired points are processed THEN the system SHALL create expiration transaction records
4. WHEN point balance is calculated THEN the system SHALL exclude expired points from available balance
5. WHEN expiration job runs THEN the system SHALL process all expired points and update member balances
6. IF expiration processing fails THEN the system SHALL log errors and retry with exponential backoff
